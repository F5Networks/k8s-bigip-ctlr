    A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
    ==========================

    Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
    Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
    as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
    principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

    In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
    National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
    in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
    software.

    In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
    BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
    year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
    Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
    Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
    non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
    Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
    the PSF.

    All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
    the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
    releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
    the various releases.

    Footnotes:

    (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
        the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
        a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
        GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
        other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

    (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
        because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
        CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
        is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

    Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
    direction to make these releases possible.

    unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle): 1895.22/1013.  This

    INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

    5. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
    1.6.1 FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
    A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 1.6.1,
    OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

    6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
    breach of its terms and conditions.

    7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
    intellectual property law of the United States, including without
    limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
    U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
    Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
    on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
    previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
    law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
    Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
    Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
    License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
    agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
