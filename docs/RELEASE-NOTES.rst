Limitations
```````````
* If you are deploying services using the F5-supported iApps, you must upgrade to a version that supports
  route domain 0 for non-Common partitions. The minimum versions required for the F5 iapps are:

  - f5.http: ``f5.http.v1.3.0rc3``
  - f5.tcp: ``f5.tcp.v1.0.0rc3``

  You can find these versions in the iapp package ``iapps-1.0.0.492.0``. To upgrade, you must perform the following:

  - `Download and install the latest iApps templates`_.
  - `Set the service to use the newer iApp template`_.

* Check BIG-IP version compatibility on Application Services (iApps) before deploying. See Application Services Integration iApp `[#16] <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-application-services-integration-iApp/issues/16>`_ for more information.
* Cannot delete ARP entries on BIG-IP v11.6.1 when running the Controller in Kubernetes with Flannel VXLAN enabled.

v1.3.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Create health monitors for OpenShift Routes via an annotation.

  profiles on the BIG-IP system.
* Optionally disable loading of Kubernetes Secrets on an Ingress.
* Resolve the first host name in an Ingress to an IP address using a local or custom DNS server. The controller
  configures the virtual server with this address.
* Support for BIG-IP partitions with non-zero default route domains.

Bug Fixes
`````````
* OpenShift Route targetPort field is no longer required if the port is not 80 or 443.
* Properly configure named targetPorts in OpenShift Route configurations.
* Remove ssl certificate lists for deleted custom profiles.

Limitations
```````````

* If a Route configuration contains no targetPort, the controller uses the first port it sees
  on the referenced Service. The controller does not use all ports.
* You cannot change the default route domain for a partition managed by an F5 controller after the controller has deployed. To specify a new default route domain, use a different partition.

v1.2.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Introduced support for Kubernetes 1.6 and 1.7.
* Watch all nodes by default; watch a subset of nodes with a user-specified label.
* Create BIG-IP SSL Profiles from Kubernetes Secrets via Ingress TLS.
* Create BIG-IP objects from OpenShift Route resources.
  - This includes unsecured, edge, passthrough, and re-encrypt Routes.

* This is a feature-complete upgrade from the OpenShift F5Router.
  See `Replace the OpenShift F5 Router with the BIG-IP Controller <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/latest/openshift/replace-f5-router.html>`_ for more information.

Bug Fixes
`````````
* Properly configure http redirect rules on v11.6.1 BIG-IP systems.
* Failed configurations for objects do not prevent future configurations from happening.

Limitations
```````````

* OpenShift - Does not currently support redirect for individual Routes. If a Route specifies
  "insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy" as "Redirect", the http virtual server will enable this policy for all Routes.

v1.1.1
------

Bug Fixes
`````````

------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Create detached pools if virtual server bind addresses not specified.
* Container image size reduced from 361MB to 123MB.
* Can use local and non-local BIG-IP users.

Limitations
```````````

  Any Secret resources configured in Kubernetes are not used.

v1.0.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Can manage multiple BIG-IP partitions in the following environments

  * Kubernetes
  * Red Hat OpenShift

* Manages the following LTM resources for the BIG-IP partition(s)

  * Virtual Servers
  * Virtual Addresses
  * Pools
  * Pool Members
  * Nodes
  * Health Monitors
  * Application Services

* Manages the following Network resource for the BIG-IP partition(s)

  * FDB tunnel records (Red Hat OpenShift)

Limitations
```````````

* Cannot share endpoints managed in a partition controlled by the K8S BIG-IP Controller with endpoints managed in another partition.
* Kubernetes allows a service to name the individual service ports within a particular service.  However, the K8S BIG-IP Controller requires the virtual server section within the configmap to refer to the port number for the service port, not the name.
* Two virtual servers cannot point to the same servicePort.  The last one specified will be the one that remains configured.
* The BIG-IP Controller does not handle non-zero route domains.  All managed partitions should use the default route domain (0).
* Parameters other than IPAddress and Port (e.g. Connection Limit) specified in the iApp Pool Member Table apply to all members of the pool.
* Cannot configure virtual servers with IPv6 addresses in the configmap.
* The K8S BIG-IP Controller cannot watch more than one namespace.
