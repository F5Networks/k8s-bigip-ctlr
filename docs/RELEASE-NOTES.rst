Release Notes for BIG-IP Controller for Kubernetes
==================================================

|release|
---------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Introduced support for Kubernetes 1.6 and 1.7.
* Watch all nodes by default; watch a subset of nodes with a user-specified label.
* Create BIG-IP SSL Profiles from Kubernetes Secrets via Ingress TLS.
* Create BIG-IP objects from OpenShift Route resources.
  - This includes unsecured, edge, passthrough, and re-encrypt Routes.

* This is a feature-complete upgrade from the OpenShift F5Router. 
  See `Replace the OpenShift F5 Router with the BIG-IP Controller <http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/latest/openshift/replace-f5-router.html>`_ for more information.

Bug Fixes
`````````
* Properly configure http redirect rules on v11.6.1 BIG-IP systems.
* Failed configurations for objects do not prevent future configurations from happening.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* OpenShift - Does not currently support redirect for individual Routes. If a Route specifies 
  "insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy" as "Redirect", the http virtual server will enable this policy for all Routes.

v1.1.1
------

Bug Fixes
`````````
* Fix SIGSEV on non-"f5" valued class annotation `[#311] <https://github.com/F5Networks/k8s-bigip-ctlr/issues/311>`_
* Remove default pool for Ingress and Routes `[#288] <https://github.com/F5Networks/k8s-bigip-ctlr/issues/288>`_

v1.1.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Creation of BIG-IP Virtual Servers from Kubernetes Ingress resources.
* Configure multiple SSL Profiles for a BIG-IP Virtual Server.
* Watch all Kubernetes namespaces by default; watch a list of namespaces; watch namespaces with a user-specified label.
* Watch for Kubernetes annotation if virtual address not specified, enabling custom IPAM integration.
* Create detached pools if virtual server bind addresses not specified.
* Container image size reduced from 361MB to 123MB.
* Can use local and non-local BIG-IP users.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The SSL Profiles referenced in Ingress resources must already exist on the BIG-IP device.
  Any Secret resources configured in Kubernetes are not used.

v1.0.0
------

Added Functionality
```````````````````

* Can manage multiple BIG-IP partitions in the following environments

  * Kubernetes
  * Red Hat OpenShift

* Manages the following LTM resources for the BIG-IP partition(s)

  * Virtual Servers
  * Virtual Addresses
  * Pools
  * Pool Members
  * Nodes
  * Health Monitors
  * Application Services

* Manages the following Network resource for the BIG-IP partition(s)

  * FDB tunnel records (Red Hat OpenShift)

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Cannot share endpoints managed in a partition controlled by the K8S BIG-IP Controller with endpoints managed in another partition.
* Kubernetes allows a service to name the individual service ports within a particular service.  However, the K8S BIG-IP Controller requires the virtual server section within the configmap to refer to the port number for the service port, not the name.
* Two virtual servers cannot point to the same servicePort.  The last one specified will be the one that remains configured.
* The BIG-IP Controller does not handle non-zero route domains.  All managed partitions should use the default route domain (0).
* Parameters other than IPAddress and Port (e.g. Connection Limit) specified in the iApp Pool Member Table apply to all members of the pool.
* Cannot configure virtual servers with IPv6 addresses in the configmap.
* The K8S BIG-IP Controller cannot watch more than one namespace.
