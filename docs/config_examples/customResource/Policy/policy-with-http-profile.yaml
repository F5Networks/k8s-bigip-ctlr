# Example of policyCR with the http profile
# CIS now allows for greater control over which Virtual Server(secured, unsecured or both) HTTP profile is applied on.
# HTTP profile field supports two parameters: bigip and apply
# bigip: specifies BIG-IP reference for the HTTP profile. By default, it's empty.
# apply: determines on which Virtual Server(secured, unsecured or both) the HTTP profile is applied on. By default, it's applied on both the Virtual servers(secured and unsecured VS)
# valid values for apply are [http, https, both]
