# Note: If both `http` and `httpProfiles` are specified, the `http` field takes precedence over `httpProfiles`.
# Use `httpProfiles` to reference custom HTTP profiles for secure and insecure traffic.
# Use the `http` field only when you want to override all HTTP profile settings with a single profile.
