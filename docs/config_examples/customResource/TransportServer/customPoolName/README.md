# Custom Pool Name

A pool can be provided with a custom name, which has to be unique across the cluster.
And this name will be used to name the Pool in BIGIP.
CIS provides an autogenerated name only if the name is not provided in the pool section of the spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: "cis.f5.com/v1"
kind: TransportServer
metadata:
  labels:
    f5cr: "true"
  name: svc1-tcp-transport-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  ipamLabel: "Dev"
  mode: standard
  snat: auto
  pool:
    service: svc-1
    name: transport-service
    servicePort: 8181
    monitor:
      type: tcp
      interval: 10
      timeout: 10
```
