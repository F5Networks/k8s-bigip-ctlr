## Overview

Multi-Cluster Support in CIS allows users to expose multiple apps spread across OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters using a single BIG-IP Virtual Server. An app can be deployed in different OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters exposing them using a Route/VS/TS CR resource. Using a Multi-Cluster implementation the CIS can be deployed in a HA topology, or Standalone CIS, to expose the apps spread across OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters.


**Note**: 
* CIS supports processing of routes in traditional way as well as with NextGen Controller and with Multi-Cluster support.
* At present, nodePort mode is supported and Cluster mode is available with static route configuration on BIGIP(No tunnels)

## Prerequisites
* Cluster node, where CIS is deployed, should be able to reach the API server of all OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters.
* extendedConfigMap needs to be created to run CIS in Multi-Cluster mode.
* kube-config files for each cluster should be available for CIS to access resources such as Pods/Services/Endpoints/Nodes.

## Topologies

### Standalone CIS

In a Standalone deployment of CIS, CIS is only deployed in one cluster, then create a route resource with a Multi-Cluster annotation or CRD resource with extendedServiceReferences to expose the apps in different OpenShift/K8s clusters.

Below is the sample Multi-Cluster Config in an Extended ConfigMap.
```
  extendedSpec: |
    externalClustersConfig:    -------------------------------------|----------------------------|                            |
    - clusterName: cluster3                                      |                            |
      secret: default/kubeconfig3                                |---> Cluster configs for    |
    - clusterName: cluster4                                      |     all other clusters     |
      secret: default/kubeconfig4                                |     except HA clusters     |
    - clusterName: cluster5                                      |                            |
      secret: default/kubeconfig5  ------------------------------|----------------------------|
    extendedRouteSpec:
    - namespace: foo   -------------------------------------|
      vserverAddr: 10.8.0.4                                 |
      vserverName: nextgenroutes                            |----------------> RouteGroup with namespace
      allowOverride: true                                   |
      bigIpPartition: MultiTenant                           |
      policyCR: default/sample-policy  _____________________|
    - namespace: bar -------------------------------------|
      vserverAddr: 10.8.0.5                               |----------------> RouteGroup with namespace
      allowOverride: false           _____________________|
```
**Note**: extendedRouteSpec is only applicable in case of openshift route resources not for CRD resources.

### High Availability CIS

#### Prerequisites
  * A pair of High Availability OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters should be available, which have the same applications running in both clusters.
  * HealthCheck endpoint should be available to check the health of the primary cluster. Currently, TCP/HTTP Health endpoints are supported.


In HA deployment of CIS, CIS needs to be deployed in both the primary and secondary cluster. Also, the same extendedConfigMap needs to be deployed in both the primary and secondary cluster. 
CIS will look for the same service name in both primary and secondary clusters to expose the application via routes. Additionally, a Multi-Cluster annotation is created in the route definition exposing the applications in the other clusters.

Deploying CIS HA in Two Modes:
 * active-active and active-standby mode are used in case of CIS running in High Availability mode.
 * Based on the provided value the CIS running on Primary cluster decides whether to monitor the workloads running on Secondary Cluster or not.
 * In case of active-active mode CIS running on Primary cluster updates the pool members for Virtual Servers from both the clusters those are part of HA Cluster(Primary and Secondary Clusters) as well as pool members from all other remotely monitored clusters.
 * Whereas in case of active-standby mode CIS running on Primary cluster updates the pool members for Virtual Servers only from Primary Cluster and from all the other remotely monitored clusters except Secondary cluster.
 * However, in case the Primary cluster is down and CIS on the Secondary cluster has taken control then pool member from the Secondary Cluster as well as all other remotely monitored clusters are populated for the Virtual Servers irrespective of the value of HA mode.

**Note:**
 * Additionally, there is another supported mode called "ratio", in which pool members from all the Kubernetes/Openshift clusters are update for the Virtual Server, however the traffic distribution is done based on the ratio values defined for each cluster.
 * Ratio doesn't require CIS to be running in HA environment. It is supported in both CIS HA and non-HA environment.

**Note**:
* For HA mode [namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio], CIS monitored resource manifests(such as routes, CRDs, extendedConfigmaps) must be available in both the clusters. 
* The CIS monitored resource manifests must be identical on both primary and Secondary Clusters
* So, In case of CIS failover, CIS on Secondary Cluster will take control and will start processing the CIS monitored resource manifests.
* CIS on Secondary Cluster will not process the CIS monitored resource manifests if they are not available in Secondary Cluster.
* MakeSure to have identical resource manifests in both the clusters to avoid any issues during CIS failover.

Below is a tabular representation of the scenarios mentioned above:

###### When Primary Cluster is healthy and CIS is running on it

| HA Mode values | Primary Cluster Pool Members | Secondary Cluster Pool Members | Other remotely monitored clusters Pool Members | Traffic distribution based on ratio |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| active-active  | Yes                          | Yes                            | Yes                                            | No                                  |
| active-standby | Yes                          | No                             | Yes                                            | No                                  |
| ratio          | Yes                          | Yes                            | Yes                                            | Yes                                 |


###### When Primary Cluster is down, which means CIS in Secondary cluster has the control

| HA Mode values | Primary Cluster Pool Members | Secondary Cluster Pool Members | Other remotely monitored clusters Pool Members | Traffic distribution based on ratio |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| active-active  | No                           | Yes                            | Yes                                            | No                                  |
| active-standby | No                           | Yes                            | Yes                                            | No                                  |
| ratio          | Yes                          | Yes                            | Yes                                            | Yes                                 |

## Configuration

### Openshift Routes with multi-cluster

### CIS Deployment Parameter

If you are using multi-cluster mode, ```--multi-cluster-mode``` parameter is a required parameter.


| Parameter          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                    | Allowed Values                     |
|--------------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| multi-cluster-mode | String | Required | Specify whether CIS is running standalone or as primary/secondary in the case of a high availability topology. | standalone or primary or secondary |

**Note**: Here **standalone** refers to standalone topology of CIS deployment, See [Standalone CIS](#standalone-cis).

Following is the sample deployment for primary CIS deployment:

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --bigip-partition
        - <partition>
        - --bigip-url
        - <ip-address>
        - --bigip-username
        - <user-name>
        - --bigip-password
        - <password>
        - --log-level
        - DEBUG
        - --insecure
        - --controller-mode=openshift
        - --extended-spec-configmap=kube-system/extended-spec-config
        - --route-label=systest
        - --pool-member-type
        - nodeport
        - --multi-cluster-mode=primary
        command:
        - /app/bin/k8s-bigip-ctlr
        image: <image-name>
```

**Note:** 
1. Update the ```multi-cluster-mode``` to *secondary* for secondary CIS deployment in high availablility topology, See [High Availability CIS](#high-availability-cis). 
2. Update the ```multi-cluster-mode``` to *standalone* for standalone topology, See [Standalone CIS](#standalone-cis).

**Note**:
* For HA mode [namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio], CIS monitored resource manifests(such as routes, CRDs, extendedConfigmaps) must be available in both the clusters.
* The CIS monitored resource manifests must be identical on both primary and Secondary Clusters
* So, In case of CIS failover, CIS on Secondary Cluster will take control and will start processing the CIS monitored resource manifests.
* CIS on Secondary Cluster will not process the CIS monitored resource manifests if they are not available in Secondary Cluster.
* MakeSure to have identical resource manifests in both the clusters to avoid any issues during CIS failover.

##### primaryCluster/secondaryCluster Parameters

| Parameter   | Type   | Required  | Description                                                               | Default | Examples                |

| adminState  | String | Optional  | adminState can be used to disable/enable/offline/no-pool clusters         | enable  | disable                 |


**Note**: In order to run CIS in high availability mode, multi-cluster-mode parameter (primary/secondary) needs to be set in the CIS deployment arguments.
* It's recommended to provide both primaryCluster and secondaryCluster configs in the extendedConfigMap.
* If no traffic has to be forwarded to a specific cluster then set the ratio field to 0.

##### CIS Primary Cluster Endpoint
 
Health probe parameters are provided in highAvailabilityCIS in extended configmap, helping to ensure high availability of CIS. CIS running in secondary cluster continuously monitors the health of the primary cluster. If it's down, then the secondary CIS takes the responsibility of posting declarations to BIG-IP.

**Note**: primaryEndPoint is a mandatory parameter if CIS is intended to run in Multi-Cluster HA mode. If this is not specified the secondary CIS will not run.


### Route Annotation for Multi-ClusterServices
Services running in any other OpenShift clusters, apart from the HA cluster pair, can be referenced in the route annotations as mentioned below:
```
virtual-server.f5.com/multiClusterServices: 
'[
     {
         "clusterName": "cluster2", 
         "service": "svc-pytest-foo-1-com",
         "namespace": "foo", 
         "servicePort": 80,
         "weight": 30,
     }
]'
```

        command:
        - /app/bin/k8s-bigip-ctlr
        image: <image-name>
```

**Note:**
1. Update the ```multi-cluster-mode``` to *secondary* for secondary CIS deployment in high availablility topology, See [High Availability CIS](#high-availability-cis).
2. Update the ```multi-cluster-mode``` to *standalone* for standalone topology, See [Standalone CIS](#standalone-cis).

**Note**: _weight_ needs to be specified onlyonly in A/B scenario

**Note**:
* For HA mode [namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio], CIS monitored resource manifests(such as routes, CRDs, extendedConfigmaps) must be available in both the clusters.
* The CIS monitored resource manifests must be identical on both primary and Secondary Clusters
* So, In case of CIS failover, CIS on Secondary Cluster will take control and will start processing the CIS monitored resource manifests.

```
  pools:
  - path: /tea
    serviceNamespace: tea
    service: svc-2
    servicePort: 80
    extendedServiceReferences:
    - clusterName: cluster2
      namespace: ns1
      servicePort: 8080
      service: svc-1
    - clusterName: cluster3
      namespace: ns2
      servicePort: 80

    - clusterName: cluster3
      service: svc-ext-1
      namespace: ns2
      servicePort: 8282
```

## Static Routing Mode
CIS supports configuring static routes in BIG-IP with node subnets assigned for the nodes in the OpenShift/k8s cluster.This enables direct routing from BIGIP to k8s Pods in cluster mode without vxaln tunnel configuration on BIGIP.

### Configuration
To enable the static route configuration, set --static-routing-mode to true and --orchestration-cni to CNI configured in the cluster.

| Parameter            | Type    | Required  | Description                                                                                          | Allowed values                     | Default | Agent |

Following is the sample deployment for primary CIS deployment:

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --bigip-partition
        - <partition>

```

#### Route Annotation / VS or TS MultiClusterServices Parameters

| Parameter   | Type       | Required   | Description                                             | Default | Examples |
|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| clusterName | String     | Mandatory  | Name of the cluster                                     | -       | cluster1 |
| service     | String     | Mandatory  | Name of the service                                     | -       | svc-1    |
| namespace   | String     | Mandatory  | Namespace where the service is created                  | -       | test     |
| servicePort | String/Int | Mandatory  | port of the service  (for named port use string value ) | -       | 80       |
| weight      | Int        | Optional   | weight to be used for traffic splitting                 | 0       | 20       |

### Cluster wise Ratio for traffic distribution
CIS supports distribution of traffic across clusters as per the ratio configured for each cluster in the extended ConfigMap.<br>
It works even along with A/B where different weights are defined for each service. In such a case the ratio of traffic 
distribution is computed taking into consideration both the service weights and cluster ratio.<br>
However, the ratio of the clusters those haven't hosted any services linked to the concerned route are not taken into consideration 
while computing the final ratio.<br>

**Note:** 
* Cluster wise ratio for traffic distribution is supported in HA as well as non-HA CIS environment.
* Ratio is only supported for NextGen Routes and Virtual Server CR.
* Setting cluster adminState in conjunction with cluster ratio will affect the overall traffic distribution across clusters.
  As the clusters marked as disable or offline will not receive traffic, so any ratio defined for these clusters will be rendered ineffective.
  Thus, in such a scenario it's recommended to set the cluster ratio to 0 for all the clusters marked with disable/offline.

### Cluster adminState to enable/disable/offline a cluster
adminState can be provided for a cluster to dictate the state of a particular cluster.
Supported values for adminState are [enable, disable, offline, no-pool]<br>
By default clusters are in enabled state.<br>
**adminState: enable**, all new connections are allowed to the pool members from the cluster.<br>
**adminState: disable**, all new connections except those which match an existing persistence session are not allowed for the pool members from the cluster.<br>
**adminState: offline**, no new connections are allowed to the pool members from the cluster, even if they match an existing persistence session.<br>
**adminState: no-pool**, in ratio mode, a service pool is not created for the affected cluster. For all other modes, pool members from the cluster are not added to the service pool. This configuration is helpful when we don't want to add pool or pool members from a particular cluster due to any reasons(for example cluster is under maintenance).<br>


**Note**:
* For HA mode [namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio], CIS monitored resource manifests(such as routes, CRDs, extendedConfigmaps) must be available in both the clusters.
* The CIS monitored resource manifests must be identical on both primary and Secondary Clusters
* So, In case of CIS failover, CIS on Secondary Cluster will take control and will start processing the CIS monitored resource manifests.
* CIS on Secondary Cluster will not process the CIS monitored resource manifests if they are not available in Secondary Cluster.
* MakeSure to have identical resource manifests in both the clusters to avoid any issues during CIS failover.


## Known issues
*  Pool members are not getting populated for extended service in ratio mode
*  CIS doesn't update pool members if service doesn't exist in primary cluster but exists in secondary cluster for Route.
*  CIS on start up in multiCluster mode, if any external cluster kube-api server is down/not reachable, CIS is struck and not processing any valid clusters config also.Workaround to remove unreachable cluster config from configmap and restart CIS
*  CIS fails to post declaration with VS with health monitors in ratio mode.Issue is observed intermittently
*  Route status is not updated in other HA cluster. For eg: Active Primary CIS cluster doesn't update the route status in Secondary HA cluster and vice-versa.
*  CIS on switch over from ratio to active-standby mode, doesn't add the external cluster services. Any change to mode, it is always recommended to restart the CIS

## FAQ

### Is --multi-cluster-mode is a required parameter for Multi-Cluster support?
Yes. Multi-Cluster support only works if --multi-cluster-mode is defined in CIS deployment.

### Is extended configMap mandatory for Multi-Cluster support?
Yes. Multi-Cluster support only works with extended configmap.

### Does extended configmap update require CIS restart?
No. It's recommended to restart CIS if any HA configuration or external cluster configurations are updated in extended Configmap. However CIS restart is not required when updating ratio in the extended Configmap.

### Does mode update require CIS restart?
Yes. CIS has to be restarted when there is a change in the mode. 

### How do you add a new cluster?
To add a new cluster, create a kube-config file with read only permissions. Then create a Kubernetes secret using the kube-config file. Refer this in secret in the extended ConfigMap to add the new cluster.
CIS dynamically reads the new kube-config of the new cluster and starts listening to the services and endpoints in the new cluster when a route refers this new cluster.

### Where do you manage the manifest or Configuration Objects like Routes, CRDs, ExtendedConfigmaps etc.?
Manifests or Configuration objects are managed centralized in Primary Cluster and if HA is desired the same manifests are expected to be in Secondary Cluster.

### What are the supported CNIs?
Currently, NodePort mode is supported.For cluster mode, static routing mode is supported to enable configuration of static routes on bigip for pod network subnets for direct routing from BIGIP to k8s Pods

### What kind of providers are supported?
CIS supports Hybrid Cloud, any public Cloud providers such as; AWS, Azure, GCP, On-Prem, VmWare, Tanzu etc. which is in same network/datacenter and can communicate with each other. 

### What kind of clusters are supported?
CIS multicluster solution is currently validated with openshift clusters and K8s clusters

### How does CIS start as a secondary Cluster?
CIS recognizes as Secondary when it starts with a deployment parameter i.e. --multi-cluster-mode=secondary

### How does Secondary CIS learn about the Primary Cluster endpoint state in HA mode?
Both of the CIS will communicate with both K8s API servers and prepares the AS3 declaration, but the secondary CIS only sends the declaration when the Primary cluster's health probe fails. As soon as primary cluster comes up, secondary CIS stops sending the declaration.

### What kind of permission is required for HA or StandAlone deployment of CIS?
No RBAC change for CIS deployment with multiCluster support. Only additional kube-config configuration with read only permission is required to access the endpoints from external cluster.

### What kind of permission is required to access external clusters (apart from HA and StandAlone)?
CIS requires read-only permission in Kubeconfig of external clusters to access resources like Pods/Services/Endpoints/Nodes.

### Can CIS manage multiple BIG-IPs?
No. CIS can manage only Standalone BIG-IP or HA BIG-IP. In other words, CIS acts as a single point of BIG-IP Orchestrator and supports Multi-Cluster.

### Is traffic splitting with cluster ratio supported?
Yes. CIS supports traffic splitting as per the ratio specified for each cluster and also works with A/B as well.

### Is A/B supported in multiCluster mode?
Yes. CIS supports A/B with multiCluster.

### Is A/B custom persistence supported in all the modes?
No. A/B persistence is supported in ratio mode and pool member type as cluster.

### Does Secondary CIS require resource manifests existing in Primary Cluster?
Yes. CIS on Secondary Cluster will not process the CIS monitored resource manifests[NextGen Routes, CRDs, extendedConfigmap] if they are not available in Primary Cluster.
This is required in case of CIS failover, CIS on Secondary Cluster will take control and will start processing the CIS monitored resource manifests.
It is suggested to maintain identical CIS monitored resource manifests in both the clusters to avoid any issues during CIS failover.
This requirement is applicable in case of CIS HA mode [namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio].

### How to configure primaryEndPoint in HA mode?
primaryEndPoint is a mandatory parameter if CIS is intended to run in Multi-Cluster HA mode[namely Active-Standby, Active-Active, Ratio]. If this is not specified the secondary CIS will not run.
Secondary CIS will continuously monitor the health of the primary cluster based on the primaryEndPoint value. If it's down, then the secondary CIS takes the responsibility of posting declarations to BIG-IP.
Supported Protocols for primaryEndPoint are HTTP and TCP.
Generally, it's suggested to use the primaryEndPoint as
  a) any available endpoint to check the health of the primary cluster.
  b) Primary CIS cluster's health check endpoint (/ready) if accessible.
  c) Primary CIS cluster's kube-api server endpoint if accessible.
Response code 200 OK is expected from the primaryEndPoint in case of HTTP Protocol.
Successful TCP connection is expected from the primaryEndPoint in case of TCP Protocol.
Secondary CIS become active if the primaryEndPoint is not accessible.
PrimaryEndPoint is optional to configure for Primary CIS.
Note: Primary CIS will not monitor the health of the Secondary CIS cluster.

### How to configure primaryEndPoint in Standalone mode?
primaryEndPoint is not applicable in Standalone mode. It's only applicable in HA mode.

### How to use CIS /ready endpoint to check the health of CIS?
Fetch the CIS PodIP and use it in the curl command as shown below from any of the cluster nodes:
```
curl  http://<CIS-PodIP>:8080/ready
```
Response code 200 OK is expected from the CIS /ready endpoint if kube-api server is accessible.
Example:
```
[root@cluster-1-worker0 ~]# curl http://10.244.1.213:8080/ready
Ok[root@cluster-1-worker0 ~]# curl http://10.244.1.213:8080/ready -v
* About to connect() to 10.244.1.213 port 8080 (#0)
*   Trying 10.244.1.213...
* Connected to 10.244.1.213 (10.244.1.213) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /ready HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
> Host: 10.244.1.213:8080
> Accept: */*

< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< 
* Connection #0 to host 10.244.1.213 left intact
Ok[root@cluster-1-worker0 ~]#
```
where 10.244.1.213 is the CIS PodIP.


### How extendedServiceReferences is different from multiClusterServices?
extendedServiceReferences is applicable for Virtual Server CR or Transport Server CR and multiClusterServices is applicable for NextGen Routes.
extendedServiceReferences is used to refer the services running in any other OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters, apart from the HA cluster pair, in the VS Pool or TS Pool.
multiClusterServices is used to refer the services running in any other OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters, apart from the HA cluster pair, in the Route annotation.

### How multiClusterServices and extendedServiceReferences are similar?
multiClusterServices and extendedServiceReferences are similar in terms of referring the services running in any other OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters, apart from the HA cluster pair.
Both are applicable to refer services running in external Clusters, apart from the HA cluster pair

### How to configure multiClusterServices in Route annotation?
multiClusterServices is a Route annotation. Below is the sample Route annotation with multiClusterServices:
```
virtual-server.f5.com/multiClusterServices:
'[
     {
         "clusterName": "cluster2",
         "service": "svc-pytest-foo-1-com",
         "namespace": "foo",
         "servicePort": 80,
         "weight": 30,
     }
]'
```
where clusterName is the name of the cluster where the service is running, namespace is the namespace where the service is running, servicePort is the port of the service and service is the name of the service.
where cluster2 is the external cluster apart from the HA cluster pair.
Note: External Clusters doesn't need to install CIS

### How to configure extendedServiceReferences in Virtual Server CR or Transport Server CR?
extendedServiceReferences is a field in Virtual Server CR or Transport Server CR. Below is the sample Virtual Server CR with extendedServiceReferences:
```
  pools:
  - path: /tea
    serviceNamespace: tea
    service: svc-2
    servicePort: 80
    extendedServiceReferences:
    - clusterName: cluster3
      namespace: ns1
      servicePort: 8080
      service: svc-1
    - clusterName: cluster4
      namespace: ns2
      servicePort: 80
      service: svc-ext-1
```
where clusterName is the name of the cluster where the service is running, namespace is the namespace where the service is running, servicePort is the port of the service and service is the name of the service.
where cluster3 and cluster4 are the external clusters apart from the HA cluster pair.
Note: External Clusters doesn't need to install CIS

### Can I specify the services running in CIS HA cluster in extendedServiceReferences/multiClusterServices?
No. ExtendedServiceReferences/multiClusterServices is only applicable to refer the services running in K8S/Openshift clusters which are not part of the HA cluster(Primary/Secondary Cluster).
