# adminState can be provided for a cluster to mark the state of a particular cluster.
# Supported values for adminState are [enable, disable, offline]
# By default clusters are in enabled state.
# adminState: enable, all new connections are allowed to the pool members from the cluster.
# adminState: disable, all new connections except those which match an existing persistence session are not allowed for the pool members from the cluster.
# adminState: offline, no new connections are allowed to the pool members from the cluster, even if they match an existing persistence session.
